Under this Iowa sky,<br />
rain falls in slits around us

the glittering eyelashes of angels<br />
who pray at god’s cloud-marbled floors.

My breath is a fist of loose<br />
wind falling away to

scared I will run out. & mother weeps<br />
at the wheel, her hips shaking

with the car’s rumbling. We drive to the end<br />
of the field, the tear

of the page full of corn lifting into the sky’s<br />
open mouth. Exhausted,

we lay in the grass<br />
its sweet sticky sweat. A lacy

grasshopper waxes by<br />
our ear &

it breaks us, that bird breaks<br />
through the glass of us

I try to catch its<br />
beats spilling down my arms.

Then corn heads unfurl<br />
toward the sky

in yellow flames.
