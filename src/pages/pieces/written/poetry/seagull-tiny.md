the villagers are<br />
watchful

in their booths at<br />
boston market

the boys living on<br />
sulfur

and talking about<br />
feelings

and memory  the<br />
united states

is the collective<br />
process of

demanding feelings<br />
and a certain

memory  i would live<br />
on synthetics

but i hate fragility<br />
Lonely and afraid,

my women sing, there<br />
is no father

in me  they talk about<br />
anything

a limit allows  there<br />
is hope

of forgiveness, but<br />
my american

corpse has been such<br />
a disappointment

i would live on<br />
feeling  safe

and  spilling  secrets<br />
it is confusing

the plain people<br />
passing

like potato blossoms<br />
when i first

met a trans person at<br />
age 7

she served us mashed<br />
potatoes

at boston market<br />
mother winced

and statistically it’s<br />
unlikely she

kept the job<br />
i am worthy

of eating food i tell<br />
myself  there

is some hope of<br />
forgiveness

for boys  i would live<br />
on their plastic

it is confusing that
words trick us
