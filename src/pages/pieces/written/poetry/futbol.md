My Pavels knew how to play soccer<br />
before I did ‘cus they played with socks rolled up<br />
into a ball in<br />
the streets in another life<br />
my name was Carlos they called me Charlie<br />
even my Pavels liked the ring<br />
of it. We used to save money for Nikes and cadenas<br />
and tamarind sweets maybe when lucky<br />
finessed some like when people leave their clothes out to dry<br />
and the wind takes them<br />
in another direction. My momma<br />
was just as brown<br />
in that life, just as good at basketball, ‘cept she had<br />
un hombre bien cabrón  <br />
named Rodolfo who played American fútbol and had a lil bell<br />
in his room on the wall by the bed<br />
to ring for help ‘cept<br />
it wasn’t help when he just wanted a beer from the kitchen yo<br />
Rodolfo was un PINCHE HUEVON<br />
Charlie and my Pavels used to pretend his face was<br />
the soccer net and when they hit the post<br />
they’d laugh like it was his<br />
arm and when Rodolfo<br />
said stuff like Charlie bring me la Corona del refri<br />
my Pavels would scream at the<br />
top of their lungs kicking and everything<br />
Charlie don’t go and<br />
I would still go I mean<br />
Charlie would still go there was nothing<br />
no young boy could say to an older mans<br />
except coming.
