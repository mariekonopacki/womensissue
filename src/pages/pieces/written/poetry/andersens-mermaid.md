Do not forget the netting. Whatever<br />
you have done to me I will not<br />
be carried away by it. To rejoice<br />
is a ghost of the mind chemically<br />
damning. So lip and impulse<br />
trained as virgin to sirens. As child:<br />
hello moon, hello moor. While the hands<br />
for landmark carry on trailing<br />
world I am looking at the lights<br />
filtering in from out the city skyscrapers<br />
adjacent face to face, as our bareness<br />
in sheets, so I pretend your touch<br />
belongs to nothing at all, and it is<br />
strange, if I must be truthful, to be<br />
so perfectly happily empty, but<br />
for the ecstatic I carried with me<br />
bodiless in buckets another time,<br />
for other men, and water, that I cannot<br />
tear from memory, is swamp<br />
and dampened, far beneath the twenty<br />
floors, and a little while away,<br />
while you are going, it will be by<br />
earth, not water.
